The model. We model a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row. (For the insulating/metallic materials example, the open sites correspond to metallic materials, so that a system that percolates has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting. For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space through which water might flow, so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.)


The problem. In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates. The plots below show the site vacancy probability p versus the percolation probability for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).

                          
When N is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that when p < p* a random N-by-N grid almost never percolates, and when p > p*, a random N-by-N grid almost always percolates. No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived. Your task is to write a computer program to estimate p*.

Percolation data type. To model a percolation system, create a data type Percolation with the following API:

public class Percolation {
   public Percolation(int N)              // create N-by-N grid, with all sites blocked
   public void open(int i, int j)         // open site (row i, column j) if it is not already
   public boolean isOpen(int i, int j)    // is site (row i, column j) open?
   public boolean isFull(int i, int j)    // is site (row i, column j) full?
   public boolean percolates()            // does the system percolate?
}
By convention, the indices i and j are integers between 1 and N, where (1, 1) is the upper-left site: Throw a java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException if either i or j is outside this range. The constructor should take time proportional to N^2; all methods should take constant time plus a constant number of calls to the union-find methods union(), find(), connected(), and count().
